## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (local or cloud, e.g. MongoDB Atlas)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/RindoGaming/Contact-thing.git
    cd Contact-thing
    ```

2. **Install server dependencies**
    ```sh
    cd server
    npm install
    ```

3. **Configure environment variables**

    Create a `.env` file in the `server` folder with your MongoDB connection string:
    ```
    MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-url>/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
    ```

4. **Start the server**
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
    The server will run on [http://localhost:6789](http://localhost:6789) by default.

## Troubleshooting

- **CORS Issues**: The server uses CORS to allow cross-origin requests.
- **Payload Too Large**: Images are limited to 1MB. Compress or resize if needed.
- **MongoDB Connection**: Ensure your connection string is correct and MongoDB is running.
